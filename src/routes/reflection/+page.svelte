			The process of creating the three projects and this e-portfolio has been beneficial to my growth as an author, web designer, and student. 
			Starting with the concepts I learned, in project one I learned what a discourse community is, adding to my existing vocabulary and helping me write in the style of a research paper.
			This statement can also be applied to project two where I learned that the word "I" is allowed in research settings, where previously I thought it was looked down upon because of how simple it sounds.
			The concept I learned in project three was genre, I was under the impression that genre was types of books, not encompassing any type of media.
			And finally in project four I was informed of composing practices for the descriptions of my artifacts I was not previously aware of.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 font-serif">
			In the future my writing will be more research-oriented, with a focus on rhetoric and getting my point across in a way that utilizes rhetorical appeals and evidence.
			Specifically I will use proper conventions when discussing genre and discourse groups.
			To elaborate, I will feel confident in my ability to describe a paper with more than just the words essay or piece and more comfortable using genre descriptions like commerical editorial or educational website article.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 font-serif">
			Next, all of these projects combined show how capable of a writer I am, directly showing the thought process I use when developing a topic.
			I learned that I enjoy strict guidelines over open assignments and that I can write even though I often don't want to.

			For the last question, I would say that my theory of writing is one that starts at the beginning, creating an interesting hook.
			Following the hook, I write the claim or thesis based on the topic of the paper and then I fill in the bridge to funnel from the broad hook to the narrow thesis.
			After that I start the body paragraphs, but I write the first sentence of all of them first before I start filling them in so that each one has a scope of its own.
			Finally after filling in all of the body paragraphs I can begin writing the conclusion, taking in the entire essay and summarizing it concisely.

            Now for some reflection on just the e-portfolio, there were some initial hurdles when making the website, especially with the home page because I kept having issues with navigation and the image animations. 
			Thankfully all of the problems were rectified with time and I was able to fix them with ease. 
			Following these homepage issues, I started creating pages based on what I saw on previous classes' e-Portfolios but quickly realized that some pages were unnecessary. 
			A good example of this is the About Me page which I originally included and is on most e-Portfolios. 
			I decided to remove this page because I realized with time that this entire website is an About Me page. 
			After all, it shows the reader what I can make and my thought process. 
			While I agree that it is easier to be served a well-written page in paragraph form detailing an entire person's life, listing projects with descriptions can be much more informative.

            Next, we were tasked with revising one of the two formal essays we wrote during the semester. 
			I chose project two for this because it was much easier for me to write initially and was more enjoyable because of its predefined structure. 
			For my revisions, I decided to modify the thesis statement to develop an argument on the message of the artifacts and modify my evidence statements accordingly. 
			I like to finish my revisions when I submit an assignment and not look back on the past, but this project opened my eyes to the possibilities of changing the existing writing to better fit a new direction I've taken in my research.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 font-serif">
            All in all, I enjoyed making this project and I can't help but recommend it for this class in the future. 
			It was a refreshing break from the stress of formal papers and gave me the motivation to put some good effort in before exam week. 
			Despite the challenges I encountered while creating it, from the homepage not working to the navigation failing, having to select two artifacts from my entire semester of class, and writing this reflection on it all, I still think this was a positive experience!
