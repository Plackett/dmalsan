			The process of creating this e-Portfolio has been beneficial to my growth as an author, web-designer, and student.
			This is evident in every page of this portfolio, from the home page which I created first, to this reflection page which was the last one I made, each page's development history demonstrates my progress over time.
			Although I have gone over and revised every page in this website, I did not change the underlying structure, keeping it the same way that I started it.
			Additionally, over the development of this page and this very reflection I uploaded my everyday progress on the Source area linked in the footer on every page of the site.

            There were some initial hurdles when making the website, especially with the home page because I kept having issues with navigation and the image animations.
			Thankfully all of the issues were rectified with time and I was able to fix them with ease.
			Following these homepage issues I started creating pages based on what I saw on previous classes e-Portfolios but quickly realized that some pages were unnecessary.
			A good example of this is the About Me page which I originally included and is on most e-Portfolios.
            I decided to remove this page because I realized with time that this entire website is an About Me page because it shows the reader what I can make and my thought process.
			While I agree that it is easier to be served a well-written page in paragraph form detailing an entire person's life, listing projects with descriptions can be much more informative.
