				When I was writing an analysis of "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman for an
				English class, I found myself stuck trying to find symbolism in objects that were not
				significant. I looked in too deeply and overanalyzed the story, but when I got my sister
				Larissa to look at my writing she gave me the best advice I could have asked for, less is
				more, she helped me realize that I was overthinking it and that I would be better off
				focusing on two specific objects throughout the story, rather than trying to analyze
				everything at once. I would like the response to my peer review draft to help me reorganize
				the paper, I am undecided on the structure and I feel like it has flow problems in its
				current state but I'm not sure how I can connect ideas between the main body paragraphs. The
				least helpful feedback would be a "Good Job!" or just compliments, negative statements would
				be much more helpful than positive ones in my paper's current state. I like what Straub says
				about being specific and writing on the side and a letter to the writer but I don't agree
				with his statement on never being short and sweet, I believe that there is a time and a
				place to be short and sweet and it is possible to be short and sweet and still give valid
				and useful feedback.
